        <h3>Using Perch CMS and the Blog app</h3>

        <p>I have been a fan of <a href="http://www.grabaperch.com" title="Perch">Perch</a> for quite some time now. In my opinion it&#8217;s the perfect Content Management System (<span class="caps">CMS</span>) for small websites that don&#8217;t need a lot of updating. With Perch it feels like I&#8217;m actually creating a website, and not filling data into a <span class="caps">CMS</span> and hacking together a template. Even after a website has been created and is up and running, it&#8217;s very simple to add Perch to it. There&#8217;s no &#8220;learning process&#8221; involved, which allows me to focus on creating websites instead of learning a <span class="caps">CMS</span>. ;)</p>

        <p>After installation, all you have to do is add references in your <span class="caps">PHP</span> files where you want content to appear. For example:</p>

        <p><code>&lt;?php perch_content(&#39;About Us&#39;); ?&gt;</code></p>

        <p>Now if you want to update the &#8216;About Us&#8217; text, you can easily do that in Perch&#8217;s web interface. No more explaining to clients what to edit and what not to edit on a <span class="caps">HTML</span> page. ;)</p>

        <p>Another awesome feature of Perch are the recently introduced <a href="http://grabaperch.com/add-ons/" title="add-ons">add-ons</a>. I have actually built this blog using the Blog add-on. In just a couple of hours, I was able to implement a fully-fledged blog into my existing website without any major changes.</p>

        <p>The downside is that Perch isn&#8217;t free. It costs Â£35 per installation. On the other hand, the developers seem to be constantly updating the system. There&#8217;s also an active community around it and support questions are usually answered within 24 hours!</p>
