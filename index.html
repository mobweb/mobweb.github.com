        <h3>Mail Templates - Now available as a Chrome web app</h3>

        <p>I&#8217;ve recently taken some time to look into all those new App Stores popping up left and right. The only that looked most interesting to me was the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore" title="Chrome Web Store">Chrome Web Store</a>. It&#8217;s basically a collection of bookmarklets that you can directly install in your Chrome browser. Some are simply a link to an external site that is optimized for Chrome, for example the &#8220;New York Times&#8217; reader application(New York Times&#8217; reader application)&#8221;: that works just as well in other browsers that support HTML5. Others are a bit more advanced and make use of specific features of the newer versions of Chrome, for example TweetDecks port of their popular Twitter software called <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hbdpomandigafcibbmofojjchbcdagbl" title="ChromeDeck">ChromeDeck</a>.</p>

        <p>Of course I was eager to check it out myself, and I was surprised how easy it is to get your Web App into the store. Because I am using <a href="http://www.phonegap.com" title="PhoneGap">PhoneGap</a> for my smartphone apps, it took me like 10 minutes to convert my iPhone &amp; iPad-App <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mail-templates-e-mails-aus/id386309395?mt=8" title="«Mail Templates»">«Mail Templates»</a> to work as a Chrome web app. All I had to do was copy my &#8220;www&#8221; folder from the PhoneGap project into a separate folder and remove references to some PhoneGap specific functions, for example the onDeviceReady listener or a plugin that I was using. After that, I quickly debugged the App directly in the Chrome browser and I was surprised again when I realized it only needed some minor <span class="caps">CSS</span> tweaks to function properly. :)</p>

        <p>After that, I signed up for the Chrome Web Store by paying a one-time 5$ administrative fee and I was able to instantly post my web app to the store.</p>
